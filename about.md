I [immigrated from Glasgow, Scotland to Toronto, Ontario](https://www.kiltandcode.com/2019/06/30/coming-to-canada-immigrating-to-toronto-as-a-dotnet-developer/) in January 2017 and moved to Stratford, Ontario in December 2019, where I live with my wife Kate and our dog Angus. I taught myself how to build websites in the late '90s and in 2006 graduated from [Glasgow Caledonian University](https://www.gcu.ac.uk/) with a BSc. in Internet Software Development.

When I'm not buried in <del>[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or</del> [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), I enjoy spending time with my wife and two dogs, watching movies and shows on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) and [Apple TV+](https://tv.apple.com/), reading [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/), listening to podcasts and patiently waiting for the [Toronto Maple Leafs](https://www.nhl.com/mapleleafs) to win the [Stanley Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup).

I hope you enjoy my minimalist area of the internet! Please get in touch by emailing me at [stevenmclintock@fastmail.com](mailto:stevenmclintock@fastmail.com).
