Azure Batch is not a new technology by Microsoft, but for some reason it doesn’t seem to be receiving as much attention as similar Microsoft cloud platforms: Azure Functions and [Logic Apps](https://kiltandcode.com/azure-logic-apps-how-to-use-microsofts-serverless-codeless-integration-platform/).

Azure Batch has a few benefits over Azure Functions / Logic Apps:

- **Reduced cost** *(Logic Apps are considerably expensive for many executions)*
- **Avoid outbound connection limit** *(Azure Functions enforce a strict outbound connection limit)*
- **Avoid time limit** *(Azure Functions must complete in a short amount of time)*
- **Configurable CPU and RAM for compute-intensive workloads**

Mark Scurrell of Microsoft can be seen in the walk-through below demonstrating some of the capabilities of Azure Batch.

{% include embed-video.html src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ol8TawZQimc?rel=0' %}

## Getting Started

The first step is to create a batch account in the Microsoft Azure Portal. We will use this account to store the jobs, pools and tasks used for executing our code at large-scale.

{%
    include image.html
    year='2019'
    month='03'
    file='1_newbatchaccount.png'
    alt='New batch account'
%}

Once created, you can navigate to the new batch account and view the **‘Keys’** associated with the account. These credentials are used when opening a new BatchClient in C#, used to access the batch account programmatically.

{%
    include image.html
    year='2019'
    month='03'
    file='2_keys.png'
    alt='Keys'
%}

## Create an application package

You can execute both C# and Python code in Azure Batch. For this example I will create a simple console application in C# to multiply 2 integers. This will simulate how Azure Batch is able to accept one or more arguments and execute code at large-scale in a production environment.

The EXE for our application package will contain the C# code block:

```csharp
using System;

namespace Multiply
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int.TryParse(args[0], out int value1);
            int.TryParse(args[1], out int value2);

            int result = value1 * value2;

            Console.WriteLine($"{value1}*{value2}={result}");
        }
    }
}
```

Zip the EXE and it’s associated files *(including dependencies, configs, etc.)*

{%
    include image.html
    year='2019'
    month='03'
    file='3_exe.png'
    alt='EXE'
%}

Navigate to **‘Applications’** within your batch account in the Azure Portal and create a new application package. You will need to provide an Application ID *(Multiply)*, Version *(1.0)* and upload the ZIP.

{%
    include image.html
    year='2019'
    month='03'
    file='4._newapppackage.png'
    alt='New app package'
%}

## Use Azure Batch to Execute

To use Azure Batch in C#, you will need to install the Nuget package **‘Microsoft.Azure.Batch’** into your solution.

{%
    include image.html
    year='2019'
    month='03'
    file='5_batchnuget.png'
    alt='Batch Nuget'
%}

To begin the C# code to executing code using Azure Batch, open the BatchClient to access the Azure batch account. You will need to use the credentials you accessed earlier in the Azure Portal.

```csharp
string batchAccountName = "XXXX";
string batchAccountKey = "XXXX";
string batchAccountUrl = "XXXX";

BatchSharedKeyCredentials cred = 
    new BatchSharedKeyCredentials(
    batchAccountUrl, 
    batchAccountName, 
    batchAccountKey);

using (BatchClient batchClient = BatchClient.Open(cred))
{
    // ...
}
```

Within the BatchClient, we will begin to configure the pool of nodes used to execute the job and associated task(s). Below we are configuring a pool of 2 nodes and associating the application package we uploaded to the pool.

```csharp
string poolId = "batchpool";

// Create a Windows Server image
ImageReference imageReference = new ImageReference(
    publisher: "MicrosoftWindowsServer",
    offer: "WindowsServer",
    sku: "2012-R2-Datacenter-smalldisk",
    version: "latest");

// Create a VM configuration
VirtualMachineConfiguration vmConfiguration = 
    new VirtualMachineConfiguration(
        imageReference: imageReference,
        nodeAgentSkuId: "batch.node.windows amd64");

// Create a batch pool
CloudPool pool = batchClient.PoolOperations.CreatePool(
    poolId: poolId,
    targetDedicatedComputeNodes: 2,
    virtualMachineSize: "STANDARD_A1",
    virtualMachineConfiguration: vmConfiguration);

string appId = "Multiply";
string appVersion = "1.0";

// Associate the application package to the batch pool
pool.ApplicationPackageReferences = 
    new List<ApplicationPackageReference>
{
    new ApplicationPackageReference
    {
        ApplicationId = appId,
        Version = appVersion
    }
};

pool.Commit();
```

One of the benefits of Azure Batch is the flexibility of configuring the VM used in the pool. If you navigate to **‘Pools’** in your batch account and create a new pool, you will be able to view the many VM configuration options *(operating system, CPU, RAM, etc.).*

{%
    include image.html
    year='2019'
    month='03'
    file='6_batchnodes.png'
    alt='Batch nodes'
%}

To reduce costs, the pool is created programmatically before the job and associated task(s) are created, and deleted once the tasks are complete.

To run the tasks, create a new job and associate it with the pool:

```csharp
string jobId = "batchjob";

CloudJob job = batchClient.JobOperations.CreateJob();
job.Id = jobId;
job.PoolInformation = new PoolInformation { PoolId = poolId };

job.Commit();
```

Create a new task and associate it with the job. In this example we will create 1 task to execute, however in a production environment we could use a loop to iterate through a collection of objects and create multiple tasks to run on many nodes.

```csharp
List<CloudTask> tasks = new List<CloudTask>();

string appPath = $"%AZ_BATCH_APP_PACKAGE_{appId}#{appVersion}%";

string taskId = "Task1";

string taskCommandLine = $"cmd /c {appPath}\\Multiply.exe 6 4";

CloudTask cloudTask = new CloudTask(taskId, taskCommandLine)
{
	ApplicationPackageReferences = new List<ApplicationPackageReference>
	{
		new ApplicationPackageReference
		{
			ApplicationId = appId,
			Version = appVersion
		}
	}
};

tasks.Add(cloudTask);

// Add all tasks to the job
batchClient.JobOperations.AddTask(jobId, tasks);
```

Once the task is created and added to the job, we wait for the task to complete, applying a timeout of 30 minutes.

```csharp
// Monitor task success/failure, specifying a maximum timeout.
TimeSpan timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
Console.WriteLine("Monitoring all tasks for 'Completed'");

IEnumerable<CloudTask> addedTasks = 
    batchClient.JobOperations.ListTasks(jobId);

batchClient.Utilities.CreateTaskStateMonitor().WaitAll(
    addedTasks, TaskState.Completed, timeout);

Console.WriteLine("All tasks reached state Completed.");
```

When the task is completed *(regardless if it resulted in an error)*, we’ll print out the results to the console window.

```csharp
// Print task output
Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine("Printing task output...");

IEnumerable<CloudTask> completedtasks = 
    batchClient.JobOperations.ListTasks(jobId);

foreach (CloudTask task in completedtasks)
{
    string output = task.GetNodeFile(
        Constants.StandardOutFileName).ReadAsString();

    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(output))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Output: {output}");
    }

    string errorMessage = task.GetNodeFile(
        Constants.StandardErrorFileName).ReadAsString();

    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(errorMessage))
    {
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
        Console.WriteLine($"Error: {errorMessage}");
        Console.ResetColor();
    }
}
```

Finally, delete the pool *(to reduce costs)* and terminate the job *(to mark it as complete in the Azure Portal)*.

```csharp
// Delete the pool
batchClient.PoolOperations.DeletePool(poolId);

// Terminate the job (marking it as completed)
batchClient.JobOperations.TerminateJob(jobId);
```

If the task was successful, you will be able to view the output of the application package, along with any error messages.
