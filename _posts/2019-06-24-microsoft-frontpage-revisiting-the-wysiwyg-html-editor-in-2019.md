In the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, before platforms such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com) offered non-programmers the ability to build websites, there were **WYSIWYG** *(What You See Is What You Get)* tools, one of these being Microsoft FrontPage.

Microsoft FrontPage was one of the first major WYSIWYG HTML editors that you could install on your Windows PC, click on a shortcut on your desktop and build a website for the blossoming World Wide Web.

I was a teenager at the time and keen to create a website to impress my friends, I used Microsoft FrontPage to begin a life long interest in the internet and technology.

I thought I’d revisit Microsoft FrontPage after 20 years ***(I feel old!)*** and install it on the operating system I used at the time, [Windows 2000 Professional](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/642671.stm).

Just installing Windows 2000 Professional was bringing back memories! When I was younger, my first PC came with [Windows Millennium Edition](https://www.thurrott.com/windows/90610/throwback-thursday-windows-millennium-edition) pre-installed. Anyone with the misfortune of using Windows ME will surely remember the notorious stability issues and the memorable *['Blue Screen of Death'](https://www.howtogeek.com/163452/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-blue-screen-of-death/)*. It’s not an understatement to say that Windows 2000 Professional was a breath of fresh air!

Launching Microsoft FrontPage for the first time in a couple of decades, I was immediately lost. The similarities to a Microsoft Office application are present in the menu and sidebar, but this isn't Microsoft Word! I can’t help but wonder how I’m supposed to add a logo, navigation or a footer?

However, at least I can test my future website in Internet Explorer 5.0 at up to 1024 x 768 resolution! Sarcasm or no sarcasm, I’d better like Internet Explorer 5.0. *What was that about a monopoly, Microsoft?*

A few tutorials later and I was ready to get started. Let’s see what this ancient relic can do!

Unlike WordPress, there seemed to be a limited amount of pre-designed templates I could use. I tried the link to search for templates on *‘Office Online’*, but I immediately got a *‘404 Page Not Found’* error, so that was a non-starter.

Once I was familiar with the interface *(after 30 minutes of trial and error)* it was surprisingly easy to apply the features to build a retro website, not too different from that [PowerPoint](https://www.free-power-point-templates.com/articles/history-of-powerpoint-the-amazing-facts-you-did-not-know/) presentation you made in the school project that earned you a B+.

I forgot how bad HTML was 20 years ago! If you didn’t need to worry about Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, never mind iOS or Android... I guess it was no big deal?

I definitely won’t be publishing this website to find out if that hit counter actually works, but it was nice to use Microsoft FrontPage again after all those years.
