It's been 2 years since I wrote the first article for this website, and nobody is more surprised than me that I've not got 
bored with it yet. Seriously - there is a shockingly high percentage of blogs that fail after the first few months, 
and I'm just glad this one hasn't *(yet!)*.

Being a bit of an introvert, I don't really enjoy writing these kind of articles, but I do enjoy reading them on 
other blogs. So, if you're sitting comfortably, let me tell you a story about a Scottish developer and his 
personal website.

## Origins of "Kilt and Code"

Basically, *"kiltandcode"* was just an amusing username I came up with for using on social media, before I got tired of 
infinitely scrolling through Twitter and Reddit. I liked how Macaulay Culkin uses the handle 
[@IncredibleCulk](https://twitter.com/incredibleculk) for his Twitter account, so I figured I'm Scottish and I like to 
code... so what's better than *"kiltandcode"*, right?!

I actually created an account on [Medium](https://medium.com) in the beginning, with the simple goal of sharing an article 
I wrote on [Azure Batch](https://www.kiltandcode.com/using-azure-batch-to-orchestrate-and-execute-code-at-large-scale/) with
a few workmates and friends on LinkedIn. Medium is great if you just want to publish something quickly, but for numerous 
reasons *(see [Why I Don't Write On Medium](https://florimond.dev/blog/articles/2019/05/why-i-dont-write-on-medium/) 
by [Florimond Manca](https://florimond.dev))* I decided to create my own personal website instead.

So here I am! For 2 years now I've been using the domain name [kiltandcode.com](https://www.kiltandcode.com), the 
static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the hosting platform [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to 
run this website.

## Ye Olde Kilt and Code

If you've ever used the website [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to see what websites used to look 
like in the past, you might get a kick out of this. I thought I'd keep a few screenshots of what this website used 
to look like in case I ever decided to write an article like this. So for your enjoyment, here's the good, the 
bad and the ugly:

    file='kiltandcode-design-2021-V2.png'
    alt='2021 (the current homepage)'
    caption='2021 (the current homepage)'
%}

## Hello? Is There Anybody Out There?

I mostly write for my future self, so I can re-learn something I've probably forgotten, like the idea of 
[Outsourcing Our Memories](https://claphaminstitute.org/outsourcing-our-memories/). With that said, it's nice 
to see  if anyone is actually out there, visiting and reading this website. It's also useful to know if an 
article does as well as I expect.

{%
    include image.html
    year='2021'
    month='03'
    file='google-analytics-trend-of-sessions.png'
    alt='Trend of Sessions in Google Analytics (2019 - 2021)'
    caption='Trend of Sessions in Google Analytics (2019 - 2021)'
%}

Fortunately, [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com) is free and easy to use, and even better, the 
traffic it's reporting is increasing over time. It was definitely quiet around here in the beginning... very 
quiet, but now the website is fast approaching 10,000 visits per month. A number that I hope to be small in 
comparison in a few years, we'll see!

## Greatest Hits

I'm actually really proud of all the articles on this website so far, even the less popular ones, but the 
articles that seem to be generating the most traffic are:

* [Show Validation Error Messages for Reactive Forms in Angular 9](https://www.kiltandcode.com/2020/08/13/show-validation-error-messages-for-reactive-forms-in-angular-9/)
* [Puppeteer Sharp: Crawl the Web using C# and Headless Chrome](https://www.kiltandcode.com/puppeteer-sharp-crawl-the-web-using-csharp-and-headless-chrome/)
* [Best Practices for Writing Unit Tests in C# for Bulletproof Code](https://www.kiltandcode.com/2019/06/16/best-practices-for-writing-unit-tests-in-csharp-for-bulletproof-code/)
* [How to Create a Blog Using Jekyll and GitHub Pages on Windows](https://www.kiltandcode.com/2020/04/30/how-to-create-a-blog-using-jekyll-and-github-pages-on-windows/)
* [My Journey to Becoming a Full Stack Developer](https://www.kiltandcode.com/2020/02/16/my-journey-to-becoming-a-full-stack-developer/)

## The Future

As well as the backlog of articles I still need to write, there's still quite a few changes I'd like to make 
to this website. I'd like to have a newsletter to increase the readership, and now that I have quite a few 
articles there's definitely a few improvements to be made in the *'All Articles'* page - such as tags, 
search and *'Related Articles'*.

Anyway, those are all for another day. For today I would just like to say thank you for reading! If you'd like
