It's been a little over [2 years now](https://www.kiltandcode.com/2021/03/25/two-years-of-kilt-and-code/) since I created this website and started writing blog posts on whatever I found interesting. Mostly on software and web development, such as [Best Practices for Writing Unit Tests in C# for Bulletproof Code](https://www.kiltandcode.com/2019/06/16/best-practices-for-writing-unit-tests-in-csharp-for-bulletproof-code/), [Show Validation Error Messages for Reactive Forms in Angular 9](https://www.kiltandcode.com/2020/08/13/show-validation-error-messages-for-reactive-forms-in-angular-9/) and [How to Create a Blog Using Jekyll and GitHub Pages on Windows](https://www.kiltandcode.com/2020/04/30/how-to-create-a-blog-using-jekyll-and-github-pages-on-windows/), but also on my early career, including [My Journey to Becoming a Full Stack Developer](https://www.kiltandcode.com/2020/02/16/my-journey-to-becoming-a-full-stack-developer/) and [Coming to Canada: Immigrating to Toronto as a .NET Developer](https://www.kiltandcode.com/2019/06/30/coming-to-canada-immigrating-to-toronto-as-a-dotnet-developer/).

During this time I chose to publish these articles on this blog *([kiltandcode.com](https://www.kiltandcode.com))*, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and using a custom [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme that I've enjoyed building from scratch and optimizing for readability and performance, moulding into the now open source theme that I've jokingly named *"[Deep-fried](https://github.com/stevenmclintock/deep-fried-jekyll-theme)"*:

The *"Deep-fried"* Jekyll theme can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevenmclintock/deep-fried-jekyll-theme) and is named after *“Scotland’s craziest takeaway”*, the delicious and ridiculously unhealthy [Deep-fried Mars bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-fried_Mars_bar). Deep-fried has **no third party libraries**, *(e.g. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) or [jQuery](https://jquery.com))* so is blazingly fast, supports [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and only includes what is absolutely necessary. You can easily customize the theme to fit your requirements, or you can tweak the built-in settings located in the [_config.yml](https://github.com/stevenmclintock/deep-fried-jekyll-theme/blob/main/_config.yml) file.

If you would like to use the Deep-fried theme on your Jekyll website, or to simply learn more, please see the detailed instructions on how to use the theme at the GitHub repository: [github.com/stevenmclintock/deep-fried-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/stevenmclintock/deep-fried-jekyll-theme).
